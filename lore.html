    <h2>StarCraft Lore — A concise summary</h2>

    <section>
      <h3>Setting</h3>
      <p>StarCraft is set in a distant part of the galaxy known as the Koprulu Sector. The story follows three major civilizations — human Terrans, the psionically-gifted Protoss, and the biologically adaptive Zerg — whose conflicts escalate into galaxy-spanning wars. The setting mixes sci-fi, politics, and ancient alien mysteries.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Key players</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Terrans:</strong> Humans exiled to the Koprulu Sector; politically fragmented but technologically versatile. Major figures include Jim Raynor and Emperor Arcturus Mengsk.</li>
        <li><strong>Protoss:</strong> Ancient, highly advanced aliens with psionic shields and strong cultural codes. They struggle with internal divisions (Conclave vs. conservative/tribal factions).</li>
        <li><strong>Zerg:</strong> A hive-mind swarm seeking genetic perfection. Led at times by the psychic Queen of Blades (Sarah Kerrigan) or controlled by other Overmind forces.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Core story (short)</h3>
      <p>The saga begins with Terran colonists and their fragile governments. Manipulation and betrayal (notably by Arcturus Mengsk) lead to the rise of insurgent leader Jim Raynor. The Zerg, originally a terrifying natural threat, are psychically enslaved and later merged with human psionic Terrans via Sarah Kerrigan, who becomes the Queen of Blades — a pivotal antagonist-turned-antihero in later arcs.</p>
      <p>The Protoss, facing the Zerg and their own civil strife, reluctantly intervene. Over multiple campaigns the three races clash over survival, control of powerful artifacts, and the fate of the sector. The narrative moves from revenge and conquest to themes of redemption, identity, and the consequences of wielding absolute power.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>Themes & tone</h3>
      <p>StarCraft blends military sci-fi with tragic character arcs. Recurrent themes include: betrayal and political manipulation, the cost of vengeance (Raynor vs. Kerrigan), the danger of sacrificing morals for victory, and questions of free will when minds are controlled (Zerg hive). The tone shifts across campaigns — from gritty rebellion to epic cosmic stakes.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Why it matters</h3>
      <p>Beyond strategy gameplay, StarCraft’s lore gives each faction meaning: Terrans fight for survival and honor, Protoss for tradition and unity, Zerg for evolution and dominance. The characters’ personal journeys (especially Kerrigan and Raynor) provide emotional weight that made StarCraft a long-lasting narrative favorite in gaming.</p>
